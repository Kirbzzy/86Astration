# 86Astration
Adds a new difficult moon to Lethal Company called Astration!

This being my first moon, it's probably very bad and unbalanced, but it functions and it is pretty playable. It is inspired by Embrion.

  ## HOW TO INSTALL
  Exract the .zip file into your modded profile's plugins folder;

  For R2modman, this should look something like:

    C:\Users\[YOUR NAME HERE]\AppData\Roaming\r2modmanPlus-local\LethalCompany\profiles\[PROFILE NAME HERE]\BepInEx\plugins

  For Thunderstore, this should look something like:

    C:/Users\[YOUR NAME HERE]\Thunderstore Mod Manager\DataFolder\LethalCompany/profiles\[PROFILE NAME HERE]\BepInEx/plugins

**This mod requires LethalLevelLaoder to run.**
